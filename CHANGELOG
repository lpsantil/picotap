0.0.3 - Removed DOS support.  May revisit that later.
        Removed JS support.  I'll repost that as different repo
        later.
        Added better Makefile.

0.0.2 - Added DOS Support via OpenWatcom.  Added popen/pclose from
        Diomidis Spinellis (C) 1988, 1990.  Implemented tempnam,
        unlink to support popen/pclose.  Moved C time capture code
        to taptime becuase OpenWatcom only supports using the POSIX
        2001 and deprecated ftime to get msec accurate clock time.
        Implementing this for OpenWatcom kinda sucked.  So close, yet
        so broken a libc.  Use mkwcc.bat to compile.  Micro-C 3.23,
        TurboC 2.01, and BorlandC 5.02 will likely be next to see
        adaptations of the OpenWatcom code.

0.0.1 - Initial release support POSIX 2008 like environments on
        GCC/clang/LLVM on Linux, OSX.  Also supports JavaScript
        TAP producers and consumers, in the browser (console.log)
        and on the server/cli via OneMonkey (not yet available).
