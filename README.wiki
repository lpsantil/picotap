= picotap - A tiny TAP generator library and TAP parser in C for Linux, OSX =

== Version 0.0.3 ==

== Date: 2014-10-04 ==

== Introduction ==
picotap is a tiny TAP generator library (test) and TAP parser (test harness) written in C.  It was inspired by code in kazuho's github projects.

== Prequisites ==
C Prequisites:
* tap requires GCC or clang/LLVM on Linux or OSX

If you get stuck in Linux or OSX, try typing '''make help''' or looking at the Examples directory.

== Building ==
Try the following:
* make
* make libtap
* make ptap
* make install
* make tests
* make runtest
* make runtap

== Examples ==
=== Making a TAP generator (a test) in C ===
* In '''./picotap''', type:
 make libtap
* Include tap.h into your test file
* Start your test source with
 plan( 10 ); // If your test plan includes 10 tests
* Each test is of the form
 ok( condition, "Info about the test" );
* '''condition''' can be any expression that resolves to true/false
* For output to stdout not part of the test plan results
** Prefix with a '''space''', '''tab''', or '''#'''
* Compile your test code by including the path to '''tap.h''' and linking to '''libptap.a'''
 cc test.c -I./picotap -L. -lptap -o test.exe
* See the '''picotap/Examples''' directory and the '''make examples''' command in '''picotap/Makefile'''

=== Making a TAP parser run (test harness) in C ===
* In '''./picotap''', type:
 make tap
* Execute the test via the tap parser
 ./tap /PATH/TO/test.exe
* '''tap''' will open a pipe to '''test.exe''', reading its stdout and parse it
* For output to stdout not part of the test plan results
** Prefix with a '''space''', '''tab''', or '''#'''
